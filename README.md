# llm-inference-bench

A controlled benchmarking and decision system for LLM inference deployments that evaluates performance, cost, and output quality across serving configurations and converts those signals into actionable deployment recommendations.

It runs standardized workload benchmarks across configurable inference stacks (runtime, precision, batching, and model settings), evaluates response quality using dataset-driven or LLM-judge evaluators, and combines results with cost assumptions to compare deployment tradeoffs in a consistent environment.

The system is designed to support engineering decision-making for production LLM systems — helping teams choose optimal serving configurations under real-world constraints such as latency SLOs, budget limits, and quality thresholds.

---

## Key Output

For each workload and deployment configuration, the system produces:

- Latency and throughput profiles under load
- Cost-normalized efficiency estimates
- Quality evaluation scores (optional but supported)
- A ranked deployment recommendation based on configurable tradeoff policies

---

## Important Context

This is a **comparative inference evaluation framework**, not a hardware microbenchmarking tool.

Results are:

- Valid within a defined and reproducible runtime environment
- Intended for deployment decisioning, not absolute performance claims
- Dependent on underlying infrastructure (GPU, runtime engine, and kernel optimizations)

---

## Why it exists

Production LLM systems are not selected based on raw model capability — they are chosen based on **end-to-end deployment efficiency across cost, latency, and quality constraints**.

This system operationalizes that decision space.

## 1. The problem

Every team running an LLM in production eventually hits the same wall:

> *"Our model is slow / expensive / unreliable under load. What knob do we turn?"*

The vLLM and SGLang documentation list **dozens** of tuning flags — `max-num-seqs`,
`enable-chunked-prefill`, `enable-prefix-caching`, `tensor-parallel-size`, `kv-cache-fraction`, `swap-space`, and so on. Most public guidance is generic ("enable chunked
prefill for long contexts") and doesn't account for the specific **GPU**, **model
precision**, and **workload shape** in front of you.

The result: engineers either (a) cargo-cult a config from a blog post, (b) over-
provision hardware to compensate, or (c) spend weeks running ad-hoc benchmarks
with one-off scripts.

This project answers the question that every ML platform engineer and solutions
architect faces:

> **"For *my* workload and *my* hardware, what vLLM configuration actually matters
> — and how do I measure it?"**

It does so by combining three things:

1. A **measurement tool** that fires realistic, concurrent load at any
   OpenAI-compatible endpoint and captures TTFT, throughput, and failure rate.
2. An **analysis layer** that turns raw measurements into a comparison report.
3. A **recommendation engine** whose rules are anchored in real benchmark data
   (NVIDIA L4 + Llama 3.1 8B FP8, validated on Red Hat OpenShift AI) — not
   blog-post intuition.

---

## 2. What this tool does

- **Measures** time-to-first-token (p50/p95/p99), end-to-end latency, throughput
  (tokens/s and requests/s), and failure rate against any streaming
  `/v1/completions` endpoint.
- **Analyzes** results across runs and produces a deployable Markdown report that
  surfaces ISL impact, the `max-num-seqs` sweep, concurrency scaling, chunked
  prefill comparison, and prefix-cache wins.
- **Recommends** a concrete vLLM configuration (`--max-num-seqs`,
  `--enable-chunked-prefill`, `--enable-prefix-caching`, replica count) for a
  given workload + hardware combination via a small, transparent rule engine.
- **Evaluates quality** against real eval prompts (50–500 samples) and produces a
  quality sidecar JSON linked to the latency result. Then **recommends** the best
  deployment balancing latency, cost, and quality — not just the fastest one.
- **Stays platform-agnostic.** The core harness has no notion of "vLLM" or
  "Baseten" or "RHOAI" — it only knows OpenAI-compatible streaming. Platform
  specifics live under `examples/`.

---

## 3. Quick start — no GPU needed

The synthetic-data path exercises the whole pipeline in under a minute without
touching a GPU. Useful for demos, CI, and verifying the install.

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the repo
git clone <this-repo>
cd llm-inference-bench

# 2. Generate the reference dataset (stdlib only, no install needed)
python data/generate_synthetic.py

# 3. Build the report
python analyze/report.py --output report.md

# 4. Get a recommendation
python playbook/advisor.py \
  --isl 2048 --latency-sla 700 --concurrency 20 \
  --scale mixed --gpu l4 --model-precision fp8
```

`generate_synthetic.py`, `report.py`, and `advisor.py` are **stdlib-only** — no
`pip install` needed. `aiohttp` is required only for the live benchmark in step 4
of the next section.

---

## 4. Quick start — against a running endpoint

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt    # installs aiohttp

python collect/run_bench.py \
  --endpoint http://localhost:8000/v1/completions \
  --model llama-3.1-8b \
  --isl 2048 --osl 128 \
  --concurrency 10 --duration 90 \
  --tag my_first_run

python analyze/report.py --output report.md
```

For authenticated endpoints (Baseten, RHOAI with auth enabled, cloud-managed
inference), add `--token $API_KEY`. The benchmark adds a `Bearer` header only
when `--token` is provided, so it works with both authenticated and open endpoints
from the same script.

See the [platform guides](#68-examples--platform-specific-guides) for full
walkthroughs against local vLLM, Baseten, and RHOAI.

---

## 5. Quality-aware benchmarking

Most inference benchmarks answer: *"Which configuration is fastest?"* This tool goes further:

> **"Is the faster deployment actually good enough — in quality and cost?"**

### Pipeline

```text
collect/run_bench.py      →  results/real/<tag>.json         (latency)
evaluate/run_eval.py      →  results/quality/<tag>.json      (quality sidecar)
analyze/deployment_advisor.py --tags t1 t2 t3               (recommendation)
```

The evaluation pipeline is **offline and separate** from the load test — it sends 50–500 representative prompts at low concurrency (5) so it does not warm the KV cache or interfere with a parallel load test.

### Example

```bash
# 1. Run the quality evaluator against a deployment
python evaluate/run_eval.py \
  --endpoint http://localhost:8000/v1/completions \
  --model llama-3.1-8b \
  --latency-result results/real/vllm_l4fp8_isl2k_c10.json \
  --dataset datasets/rag.jsonl \
  --evaluator deepeval \
  --eval-model gpt-4o \
  --cost-per-million-tokens 0.80

# 2. Compare deployments
python analyze/deployment_advisor.py \
  --tags vllm_a100fp16 vllm_l4fp8 vllm_l4int4 \
  --baseline vllm_a100fp16 \
  --quality-threshold 0.10
```

**Output:**

```text
=== Deployment Recommendation ===

Recommended: vllm_l4fp8

  Latency Improvement:  42.5%  (200ms → 115ms TTFT p50)
  Cost Reduction:       33.3%  ($1.20 → $0.80 per 1M tokens)
  Quality Delta:        -2.0%  (0.900 → 0.880)

Eliminated: vllm_l4int4 — quality drop 18.0% exceeds threshold (10.0%)

Tradeoff Table:
  Tag                    TTFT p50   Tok/s    Quality   Cost/1M    Status
  vllm_a100fp16           200ms      200    0.900      $1.20     baseline
  vllm_l4fp8              115ms      262    0.880      $0.80     RECOMMENDED
  vllm_l4int4              80ms      400    0.720      $0.50     eliminated
```

### Quality sources

| Evaluator | When to use | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deepeval` (default) | Automated CI runs, reproducible scoring | `pip install deepeval` + OpenAI API key for judge model |
| `llm-judge` | Any OpenAI-compatible judge endpoint | Same flags, no extra install |

### Datasets

Three built-in eval datasets under `datasets/`:

| File | Workload | Prompts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `datasets/chat.jsonl` | Customer support / enterprise chat | 15 |
| `datasets/rag.jsonl` | RAG over claim documents | 15 |
| `datasets/long_context.jsonl` | Long-document analysis and summarization | 15 |

Each row: `{"schema_version": 1, "id": "...", "workload": "...", "prompt": "...", "expected": "..."}`.

Use `--dry-run` on either script to validate inputs without hitting endpoints or the judge model.

---

## 6. Components

The repo has five executable pieces (`run_bench`, `report`, `advisor`,
`generate_synthetic`, plus the example assets). They are intentionally
**decoupled** — the benchmark writes JSON, everything else reads it. This means
the GPU is only needed for data collection; analysis and recommendations run
anywhere.

### 6.1 `collect/run_bench.py` — the benchmark harness

The only component that needs a network connection to a model.

**What it does.** Spawns `--concurrency` async workers that each issue
streaming requests to `--endpoint` for `--duration` seconds. For every request
it captures:

- **TTFT** (time to first token) — measured as the wall-clock delta between
  request send and the first non-empty streamed token chunk. This is the
  metric users actually feel.
- **End-to-end latency** — time until `[DONE]` or stream close.
- **Tokens generated** — used to compute throughput.
- **Success/failure** — non-200 responses and exceptions are counted, not
  crashed on.

**Key arguments.**

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--endpoint` | OpenAI-compatible completions URL (default `http://localhost:8000/v1/completions`) |
| `--model` | Model name as served by the runtime (required) |
| `--isl` | Approximate input sequence length in tokens (default 512). Selects one of three realistic enterprise prompts (512/2048/4096) — *not* lorem ipsum |
| `--osl` | Max output tokens (default 128) |
| `--concurrency` | Number of concurrent virtual users (default 10) |
| `--duration` | Test duration in seconds (default 90) |
| `--tag` | Result filename tag, e.g. `vllm_isl2k_c10` (required) |
| `--token` | Bearer token for authenticated endpoints (optional) |
| `--runtime` | Metadata only: `vllm`, `sglang`, etc. (default `vllm`) |
| `--chunked-prefill` | Metadata only — records which config was active for this run |
| `--shared-prefix` | Prepends a fixed system prompt to every request, for prefix-cache testing |
| `--output-dir` | Where to write the JSON (default `./results/real`; supports `~/path`) |

**Output.** A single JSON file at `<output-dir>/<tag>.json` with the schema:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "tag": "vllm_isl2k_c10",
    "runtime": "vllm",
    "model": "llama-3.1-8b",
    "gpu": {"name": "NVIDIA L4", "memory_mb": 23034, "util_pct": 0},
    "config": {"chunked_prefill": false, "tensor_parallel_size": 1, "shared_prefix": false},
    "workload": {"isl_approx": 2048, "osl_max": 128, "concurrency": 10, "duration_secs": 90},
    "synthetic": false,
    "timestamp": "2026-05-23T16:17:04+00:00"
  },
  "metrics": {
    "ttft_ms": {"p50": 115.1, "p90": 116.5, "p95": 132.8, "p99": 194.8, "mean": 110.4},
    "total_latency_ms": {"p50": 4966.6, "p95": 4987.1, "p99": 5012.5},
    "throughput_tokens_per_sec": 261.7,
    "throughput_req_per_sec": 2.04,
    "total_requests": 190,
    "successful_requests": 184,
    "failed_requests": 6
  }
}
```

**Design notes.**

- All hot-path globals (`ENDPOINT`, `MODEL`, `TOKEN`, `USE_SHARED_PREFIX`) are
  declared at module level and assigned once at the top of `main()` so worker
  coroutines avoid argument-passing overhead.
- The auth header is added **only** when `--token` is non-empty, so the same
  script works against open localhost endpoints and authenticated cloud endpoints.
- GPU info comes from `nvidia-smi`; absence falls back to `"unknown"` rather
  than crashing — important for running the harness from a bastion that does
  not have GPUs.
- The three built-in prompts (insurance support / claim review / portfolio
  review) simulate realistic enterprise workloads. Synthetic lorem ipsum
  changes prefill cost characteristics and produces misleading numbers.

### 6.2 `analyze/report.py` — Markdown report generator

Reads every JSON file under `results/real/` and `results/synthetic/` and emits
a single Markdown report. **Real measurements override synthetic rows that
share the same `tag`** — so once you start collecting real data, the synthetic
reference quietly steps out of the way.

**Sections produced.**

1. **Header** — runtimes, GPUs, models, run counts, timestamp range.
2. **ISL impact table** — TTFT and throughput as a function of input length at
   low concurrency.
3. **Chunked prefill comparison** — paired off/on rows when both exist, with a
   callout explaining the L4-FP8 zero-benefit finding when relevant.
4. **`max-num-seqs` sweep** — the headline 172x finding.
5. **Concurrency vs throughput** — saturation curve at fixed ISL.
6. **Prefix caching comparison** — on vs off.
7. **Deployment recommendations table** — chat / RAG / long-context profiles.
8. **Methodological notes** — what's measured, what's an upper bound, the
   network-floor caveat.

**Arguments.**

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--output` | Output path (default `-` for stdout) |
| `--real-only` | Skip `results/synthetic/` entirely — useful once you have enough real coverage |

**Stdlib only.** No dependencies. Runs anywhere Python 3.9+ runs.

### 6.3 `playbook/advisor.py` — config recommendation engine

A small CLI rule engine that converts a workload description into a concrete
vLLM configuration. **Every rule is grounded in real benchmark data**, with
the source cited inline in the rationale string.

**Arguments.**

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--isl` | Input sequence length (tokens) |
| `--latency-sla` | TTFT p95 SLA in milliseconds |
| `--concurrency` | Expected concurrent active users |
| `--scale` | `realtime` / `mixed` / `batch` — controls capacity headroom |
| `--gpu` | `l4` / `l40s` / `a100` / `h100` (default `l4`) |
| `--model-precision` | `fp8` / `fp16` (default `fp8`) |
| `--interactive` | Prompt for inputs interactively |
| `--json` | Emit machine-readable JSON instead of formatted text |

**Rules encoded.**

- **`max-num-seqs` = `max(concurrency × 2, 64)`, capped at 256.** Rationale:
  L4 FP8 at c=50 went from TTFT p50=24,554ms (mns=8) to 143ms (mns=128) — a
  172x improvement. This is the single most impactful parameter.
- **Chunked prefill on L4/L40S FP8: disabled.** FP8 makes prefill fast enough
  that monopolization isn't the bottleneck this flag targets. Real test at
  ISL=4096, c=50 showed zero benefit.
- **Chunked prefill on A100/H100 FP16 with ISL>1024: enabled.** Literature
  shows 3–5x p95 improvement where prefill dominates.
- **Prefix caching: always enabled.** No downside; external benchmarks may
  not show the latency win due to network floor, but the GPU-level savings
  are real.
- **Replica count:** anchor 5.5 req/s sustainable per L4 FP8 replica at
  ISL=2048; scaled by `sqrt(2048/isl)`; headroom 40% for realtime, 25% for
  mixed, 10% for batch.

**Warnings emitted.**

- `concurrency > max-num-seqs` — requests will queue, TTFT will spike.
- `gpu=l4` + `precision=fp16` — VRAM pressure for 8B+ models.
- `scale=realtime` + `isl>4096` — prefill alone may exceed the latency budget.

### 6.4 `evaluate/run_eval.py` — quality evaluator

Sends eval dataset prompts to an inference endpoint at low concurrency (5 workers), scores responses with DeepEval or an LLM judge, and writes a quality sidecar JSON to `results/quality/<tag>.json`.

**Arguments.**

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--endpoint` | Inference endpoint to evaluate (required) |
| `--model` | Model name as served (required) |
| `--latency-result` | Path to the latency JSON this eval is paired with (required — sets the `latency_tag` backlink) |
| `--dataset` | Path to a JSONL eval dataset (required) |
| `--evaluator` | `deepeval` (default) or `llm-judge` |
| `--eval-model` | Judge model for DeepEval or LLM-judge (default: `gpt-4o`) |
| `--eval-endpoint` | Judge endpoint (default: `https://api.openai.com/v1`) |
| `--token` | Bearer token for the inference endpoint |
| `--eval-token` | Bearer token for the judge endpoint |
| `--cost-per-million-tokens` | Optional. Recorded in the quality sidecar for cost comparison |
| `--output-dir` | Where to write the quality sidecar (default: `results/quality`) |
| `--dry-run` | Validate inputs and print what would run, then exit |

**DeepEval metrics by workload.**

| Workload | Metrics |
| --- | --- |
| `chat`, `long_context` | `AnswerRelevancyMetric`, `GEval(correctness)` |
| `rag` (no `contexts` field) | same as above |
| `rag` (with `contexts` field) | above + `FaithfulnessMetric`, `HallucinationMetric` |

**Requires:** `pip install deepeval` (already in `requirements.txt`). When `--eval-endpoint` or `--eval-token` are provided, the process-level `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_BASE_URL` environment variables are set before DeepEval runs — safe for the CLI, but be aware of this side effect if calling `run_deepeval` as a library.

**Dataset validation.** `load_dataset` requires `schema_version: 1` in every row — any other value is a hard error. Valid workloads: `"chat"`, `"rag"`, `"long_context"`.

### 6.5 `analyze/deployment_advisor.py` — deployment decision engine

Answers: **"Given my quality requirements and cost constraints, which deployment should I choose?"**

Loads latency results and quality sidecars for each tag, computes relative deltas vs a baseline, eliminates deployments that fall below the quality threshold, and recommends the best surviving option by latency improvement.

**Arguments.**

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--tags` | Deployment tags to compare (space-separated, required) |
| `--baseline` | Tag to treat as the reference (required) |
| `--quality-threshold` | Max acceptable quality drop vs baseline (default: `0.10` = 10%) |
| `--output` | `markdown` (default, terminal-friendly) or `json` |
| `--latency-dirs` | Override latency search dirs (default: `results/synthetic results/real`) |
| `--quality-dir` | Override quality sidecar dir (default: `results/quality`) |
| `--dry-run` | Load all tags and print a summary, then exit |

**Cost model.** Uses `--cost-per-million-tokens` from the quality sidecar when available on both profiles. Falls back to throughput ratio as a proxy. Shows "N/A" when neither is available.

**Hard errors.** The advisor stops immediately (with a clear message) on:

- Tag not found in any latency directory
- `latency_tag` in quality sidecar doesn't match the loaded tag — stale sidecar can silently corrupt a recommendation
- `meta.model` in quality sidecar differs from latency result model
- Profiles being compared carry quality scores from different eval datasets — results are not comparable

**Relation to `playbook/advisor.py`.** The playbook advisor answers "what vLLM flags should I use?" The deployment advisor answers "which quantization / precision / configuration should I deploy?" Two advisors, two levels of the stack — neither replaces the other.

### 6.6 `data/generate_synthetic.py` — reference dataset

Generates ~23 JSON files under `results/synthetic/` containing scenarios that
are too expensive or impractical to measure on every workstation: A100/H100
FP16 comparisons, SGLang/vLLM throughput differences, ISL interpolation
between measured points, the full `max-num-seqs` sweep, and so on.

**All synthetic rows are tagged `synthetic: true`.** The values are
extrapolated conservatively from six anchor measurements taken on the real
L4/FP8 validation run (documented in [BENCHMARK_FINDINGS.md](BENCHMARK_FINDINGS.md)):

| Anchor | TTFT p50 | TTFT p95 | Throughput |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ISL=512, c=10 | 75ms | 81ms | 262 tok/s |
| ISL=2048, c=10 | 115ms | 133ms | 262 tok/s |
| ISL=4096, c=50 | 134ms | 335ms | 641 tok/s |
| `mns=8`, c=50 | 24,554ms | — | 206 tok/s |
| `mns=32`, c=50 | 7,787ms | — | 502 tok/s |
| `mns=128`, c=50 | 143ms | — | 714 tok/s |

When real data overrides a synthetic row, the report quietly upgrades. This
gives newcomers a complete-looking dataset on day 1 and a path to displace
synthetics with real measurements over time.

### 6.7 `workloads/*.yaml` — workload profiles

Three YAML workload profiles you can pass directly to `advisor.py` (or use as
config inputs in your own tooling):

| File | ISL | OSL | Concurrency | SLA | Scale |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| [`chat.yaml`](workloads/chat.yaml) | 512 | 128 | 20 | 300ms | realtime |
| [`rag.yaml`](workloads/rag.yaml) | 2048 | 256 | 30 | 700ms | mixed |
| [`long_context.yaml`](workloads/long_context.yaml) | 4096 | 512 | 50 | 2000ms | batch |

Each file also records the baseline L4/FP8 measurement for that profile so
you can sanity-check your own numbers against the validation run.

### 6.8 `examples/` — platform-specific guides

The benchmark harness is generic; deployment platforms aren't. These guides
get you from "I have an account" to "I have a benchmark JSON" on each
platform:

- **[`examples/local-vllm/QUICKSTART.md`](examples/local-vllm/QUICKSTART.md)** —
  install vLLM, serve a model, benchmark it. Covers Docker, SGLang as a drop-in
  alternative, and GPU memory requirements by model size.
- **[`examples/baseten/QUICKSTART.md`](examples/baseten/QUICKSTART.md)** —
  benchmark a Baseten-deployed model. Covers endpoint URL shape, API keys,
  cold-start warming, and how to A/B latency-optimized vs throughput-optimized
  deployments.
- **[`examples/rhoai/RUNBOOK.md`](examples/rhoai/RUNBOOK.md)** — the full
  runbook used to collect every "real" data point in this repo. Includes
  `ServingRuntime` and `InferenceService` manifests, route exposure,
  parameter-patching commands, and troubleshooting for the issues encountered
  (orphaned `LLMInferenceService` CRDs, route port-forwarding gotchas, token
  expiry).
  - [`examples/rhoai/serving_runtime.yaml`](examples/rhoai/serving_runtime.yaml) — the RHAIIS `ServingRuntime`
  - [`examples/rhoai/isvc.yaml`](examples/rhoai/isvc.yaml) — the `InferenceService` deploying Llama 3.1 8B FP8 from an OCI registry

### 6.9 `results/` — collected and reference data

Two siblings:

- `results/real/` — populated by `run_bench.py`. Gitignored by default (see
  [section 9](#9-data-lifecycle-and-gitignore)). Each file represents one
  benchmark run.
- `results/synthetic/` — populated by `generate_synthetic.py`. Committed to
  the repo so a fresh clone has working data immediately.

`report.py` reads both directories. When the same `tag` appears in both, the
real measurement wins.

## 7. Key findings from the validation run

Validated on **NVIDIA L4 + Llama 3.1 8B FP8** via Red Hat OpenShift AI. See
[BENCHMARK_FINDINGS.md](BENCHMARK_FINDINGS.md) for the full study including
infrastructure setup, experiment design, and per-run numbers.

| Parameter | Finding |
| --- | --- |
| `max-num-seqs` 8 → 128 | **172x** TTFT improvement at c=50 (24,554ms → 143ms) |
| Chunked prefill on L4 FP8 | No measurable benefit — FP8 eliminates the problem it solves |
| Concurrency 10 → 50 | 2.4x throughput (262 → 641 tok/s) |
| External vs internal benchmarking | ~15–30ms network floor masks sub-30ms GPU optimizations |

> **These findings are hardware-specific (NVIDIA L4, FP8).** Results will
> differ on A100/H100 with FP16 — chunked prefill in particular tends to help
> there. The tool is platform-agnostic; the *interpretation* is hardware-
> aware. `advisor.py`'s rules encode this distinction explicitly.

## 9. Data lifecycle and gitignore

`results/real/*.json` is **gitignored by default** to keep the repo small and
avoid leaking sensitive endpoint identifiers in result metadata. The
`results/real/.gitkeep` placeholder keeps the directory itself present on a
fresh clone.

If you want to commit your benchmark data alongside the analysis (recommended
for reproducible postmortems and team-shared experiments), remove the
`results/real/*.json` line from `.gitignore`.

`results/synthetic/*.json` is committed so a fresh clone has a working dataset
out of the box.

## 10. Contributing

PRs welcome. Two principles:

1. **Real data beats synthetic.** When adding or changing a rule in
   `advisor.py`, anchor it to a measurement (in this repo or in published
   literature) and cite the source in the rationale string. Vibe-based rules
   get rejected.
2. **Stay platform-agnostic in `collect/`, `analyze/`, and `playbook/`.**
   Anything specific to a deployment platform (RHOAI, Baseten, SageMaker,
   Vertex, etc.) goes under `examples/`. The core tool must never grow a
   conditional on "which cloud are we on".
3. **Quality data is not optional for production decisions.** When comparing
   deployments, run `evaluate/run_eval.py` before `deployment_advisor.py`. A
   recommendation made without quality data ranks by latency only — acceptable
   for a quick filter, not for a ship decision.

Python 3.9+ compatible. `collect/run_bench.py` uses `aiohttp`; everything
else is stdlib-only.
