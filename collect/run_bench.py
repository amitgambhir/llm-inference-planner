    "Policyholder: Acme Industrial Manufacturing, commercial property policy "
    "CPP-887-2024, in force since January 2020. Annual premium $487,000. "
    "Loss event: water damage to finished goods warehouse, reported April 14 2026. "
    "Estimated loss: $1.42M (inventory) + $312K (building repairs). "
    "Cause as reported by insured: sprinkler pipe burst during overnight freeze "
    "(temperatures recorded at -8F by nearest weather station). Adjuster on site "
    "April 16: confirmed pipe failure at joint near loading bay, photographed "
    "ice formation patterns consistent with freezing. Building HVAC logs show "
    "the loading bay heater was offline from April 11 through April 15 (work "
    "order WO-2026-2841 indicates a scheduled repair that ran four days behind). "
    "Policy language: section 4.2 excludes losses 'resulting from the insured's "
    "failure to maintain heat in covered premises during freezing conditions, "
    "where such failure is not due to peril otherwise covered.' Section 4.3 "
    "however reinstates coverage where the maintenance failure was 'unforeseeable "
    "or beyond reasonable control of the insured.' Prior similar claims: none "
    "for this policyholder in the last five years. Loss control survey from "
    "September 2025 noted the HVAC contractor relationship as 'satisfactory' "
    "and identified no exclusion-triggering risks. The insured argues the four-day "
    "repair delay was caused by their contractor missing parts shipments, which "
    "they could not have anticipated. The adjuster's preliminary recommendation "
    "is partial coverage at 60% pending legal review. Underwriting wants to "
    "preserve the relationship — Acme is in renewal discussions for a multi-line "
    "package worth approximately $1.2M annually. Compliance has flagged that "
    "any settlement above $750K requires senior claims officer approval and a "
    "formal coverage opinion memorandum. Task: produce a written coverage "

    "files must be reviewed together to identify portfolio-level patterns, "
    "concentration risks, and compliance gaps. Each case file is provided in "
    "full. After reviewing all four, produce a portfolio-level analysis.\n\n"
    "Case 1 — Manufacturing concentration: Acme Industrial (CPP-887-2024), "
    "premium $487K, water damage claim of $1.7M in April. HVAC maintenance gap "
    "implicated. Section 4.2 exclusion under review. Acme is also one of seven "
    "metals-fabrication accounts in the portfolio, total premium $3.1M. Three "
    "of those seven accounts share the same regional HVAC contractor (NorthernPlex "
    "Mechanical) which has been associated with two prior maintenance-related "
    "claims in 2024. Compliance flag: vendor concentration risk not previously "
    "documented in portfolio review. Action item from January: 'review shared-"
    "vendor exposure across metals book' — not yet completed.\n\n"
    "Case 2 — Tech sector cyber: DataMesh Cloud Services (CYB-441-2025), "
    "premium $612K, ransomware claim of $4.2M reported March 8. Threat actor "
    "encrypted production databases for 11 days. Insured paid no ransom; "
    "recovery was completed from offline backups. Business interruption portion "
    "$2.8M, forensic and notification $1.4M. Policy includes $5M aggregate "
    "with $250K SIR. Sub-limit on regulatory fines $1M. Pending: state AG "
    "investigation into notification timing (DataMesh notified affected "
    "customers on day 9, statute requires within 7 days from confirmed "
    "exfiltration, but DataMesh argues exfiltration was never confirmed — "
    "only encryption). Coverage question: does the notification timing dispute "
    "trigger the regulatory exclusion in section 7.4? Three other cyber accounts "
    "in the portfolio share the same managed-service provider as DataMesh "
    "(Aegis IT Partners), creating provider-level concentration of $1.9M "
    "aggregate premium.\n\n"
    "Case 3 — Healthcare professional liability: Riverside Specialty Group "
    "(PRO-220-2023), premium $341K, malpractice suit filed February 19 alleging "
    "delayed cancer diagnosis. Plaintiff demand $3.5M. Policy limits $5M per "
    "claim, $7M aggregate. Defense panel engaged. Discovery is in early stages. "
    "Notable: Riverside has had three plaintiff demands above $1M in the past "
    "24 months. Loss ratio on this account now 87% over rolling three years. "
    "Underwriting flag from December: 'evaluate non-renewal vs rate increase + "
    "tighter conditions.' Pending renewal date: October 2026. Healthcare book "
    "overall: $14.2M premium, loss ratio 71% trailing twelve months, above the "
    "target of 62%.\n\n"
    "Case 4 — Energy property: Cascade Pipeline Operations (PRP-918-2024), "
    "premium $1.1M, no open claims this quarter but a near-miss incident "
    "reported voluntarily on February 27. Routine inspection identified a "
    "corrosion-related thinning on a 14-inch transmission line, repaired before "
    "any release occurred. Estimated avoided loss had it ruptured: $8M-$22M "
    "depending on environmental sensitivity of the rupture location. Loss "
    "control engineer notes the inspection cycle that caught this was newly "
    "tightened (every 18 months instead of 36) following a 2024 NTSB advisory "
    "on similar pipelines. Cascade has implemented the recommendations promptly. "
    "Energy book is $4.8M premium with two other transmission-line accounts "
    "on older inspection cycles.\n\n"
    "Compliance framework requires that quarterly portfolio reviews address: "
    "(a) loss ratio trends by line and segment versus targets, (b) "
    "concentration risks at the vendor, sub-segment, and geographic level, "
    "(c) any pending regulatory matters that could affect coverage outcomes, "
    "(d) action items from prior reviews that remain open, and (e) "
    "recommendations for the upcoming renewal cycle including any accounts "
    "flagged for non-renewal or restructuring.\n\n"
    "Task: produce a portfolio-level memorandum following the compliance "
    "framework above. Identify the top three concentration risks, recommend "
    "concrete actions with owners and dates, and flag any of the four cases "
    "where coverage outcome could materially affect the portfolio loss ratio. "
    "Be specific about which prior action items remain open and what should "
    "be reprioritized. Conclude with a summary table of recommended posture "
    "by account."
